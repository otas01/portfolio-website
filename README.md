# portfolio-website
This project is for my first milestone project with The Learning People. It is a portfolio website and I would certainly be improving the site as I progress in my web development journey. Being a porftolio website, it is meant to showcase my work to prospective clients and also to let them know a little more about my personal life. It also provides an easy way for me to be contacted for business consultations.
# Technologies used
  - HTML
  - CSS3
  - Bootstrap 5
# UX
  - I wanted a simple yet sophisticated website that would describe what I do at first glance and this was why I went with the style and colors I used. A website should be easy to navigate and I ensured this was the case. There are direct links to the about me, contact and porftolio sections and this is accessible throuhghout the page thanks to the fixed navbar. I also inculded a "back to top" link at the bottom of the page to further ease navigation through the site.
