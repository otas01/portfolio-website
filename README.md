# portfolio-website
This project is for my first milestone project with The Learning People. It is a portfolio website and I would certainly be improving the site as I progress in my web development journey. Being a porftolio website, it is meant to showcase my work to prospective clients and also to let them know a little more about my personal life. It also provides an easy way for me to be contacted for business consultations.
# Technologies used
  - HTML
  - CSS3
  - Bootstrap 5
# UX
  - I wanted a simple yet sophisticated website that would describe what I do at first glance and this was why I went with the style and colors I used. A website should be easy to navigate and I ensured this was the case. There are direct links to the about me, contact and porftolio sections and this is accessible throuhghout the page thanks to the fixed navbar. I also included a "back to top" link at the bottom of the page to further ease navigation through the site.
# HTML and CSS Validation
  - I used the <a> W3C HTML Validator tool</a>  to validate my HTML code.
  - I used the W3C CSS Validator tool to validate my CSS code.
# Mock up design
  - I used AdobeXD to design a mock up website before starting to write out the code for it. This was mainly for the landing page. I stuck with a simple white/black background for the other pages.
# Features
  # Navbar
     I used bootstrap 5's navbar and made it collapsible on smaller screens to keep the page neat. Each link targeted the desired area of the website. There is a logo as well which links to the landing page.
  # Social media icons
     These link directly to my profiles on Twitter and Linkedin and I could easily be contacted there as well.
  # Contact form
     Again, I created the contact form with a snippet of Bootstrap 5 code from mdbootsrap.com . I used formspree to make the contact form work so I can receive the data entered.
  # Porfolio
     There are a number of dummy images in the form of cards in the portfolio section just to show an example of how that section would look when it is populated with actual projects. Since this is my first ever website, there was no real project to include there.. for now...
  # Potential improvements
    - A better looking logo. I intend to get a more representative logo after I learn a bit about graphic design particularly for this logo.
    - Background image in landing page may be changed to a brighter, sharper image, even though this may neccessitate modifying a few colors
    - When I learn a bit more about javascript and some back end, I would use a proper method in getting form data

# Responsive testing
  - I used Google chrome developer tools to test the responsiveness of the site for different screen sizes to ensure it appeared how I wanted and to make sure it was a consistent appearance. I also checked it out on mobile phones in portrait and landscape views.
